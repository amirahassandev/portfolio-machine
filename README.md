# 🤖 Machine Learning Portfolio – Amira Hassan

Welcome to my Machine Learning portfolio!  
Driven by passion, I craft intelligent and scalable solutions to real-world problems using cutting-edge machine learning techniques.

## 🌟 About Me

I'm a **DEPI Trainee** in Machine Learning, working on projects that span:

- Image Processing & Computer Vision  
- Filtering & Feature Extraction  
- Supervised & Unsupervised Learning  
- Model Optimization & Evaluation

## 🧠 What I Do

I build ML pipelines from preprocessing to deployment, focusing on:

- 📷 **Image Classification & Object Detection**
- 🧪 **Filtering & Feature Engineering**
- 🔍 **Model Selection & Tuning**
- 🧰 **Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV**
- 🧠 **Supervised & Unsupervised Algorithms** (SVM, k-NN, CNNs, Clustering, PCA)

## 🧪 Sample Projects

- **Image Filter Comparison**: Traditional vs. learned filtering on noisy images  
- **Feature Extraction Pipeline**: SIFT, HOG, and CNN-based feature maps  
- **Model Optimization**: Hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search & Cross-Validation  
- **Unsupervised Clustering**: Segmentation and grouping using K-Means & DBSCAN

## 📁 Tech Stack

- Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV
- Jupyter Notebooks, Google Colab
